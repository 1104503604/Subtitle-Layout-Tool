00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,900
CANDY: I grew up
with the American dream.

2
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:11,533
ERIKA: But all Asian immigrants
were denied the right of

3
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:14,566
naturalized citizenship and with
the Exclusion Act,

4
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,166
the Chinese became the first
undocumented immigrants.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,000
CANDY: The American Dream is
a lovely dream to have and so

6
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:26,466
people continue to aspire;
enduring whatever it is that

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,933
they've got to do as immigrants.

8
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:34,100
HELEN: Japanese Americans fought
on the side the United States,

9
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,600
while the rest of their
family was incarcerated.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,600
ERIKA: Legal challenges were so
important because they did not

11
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,466
have political power.

12
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:48,500
And as much as tragedy is
a part of our heritage here,

13
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,266
so is possibility.

14
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,166
MAN: Asian voices
are coming out.

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,900
ALEX: You've got these
young people fighting to

16
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,666
make change happen.

17
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,966
ALISA: They had to
assert their rights.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,333
NOBUKO: It was like a giant
genie coming out of the bottle.

19
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:05,966
You couldn't put us back in.

20
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,133
THAHN: These were stories about
what it meant to be human.

21
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,300
What it meant to be resilient.

22
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,466
VIET: To transform the system
into something more just

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,700
for everyone, that's the hope
from which the Asian American

24
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,700
movement was born.

25
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,066
HARI: The country's changing
and people are freaking

26
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,400
out about it.

27
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,166
I keep hearing about the
year 2042 on the news.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,333
For those of you
who don't know,

29
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:45,266
2042 according to census
figures is the year when

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,900
white people will be the
minority in this country.

31
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,933
They'll be 49% and
white people are

32
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,200
freaking out about it.

33
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,500
Don't freak out white people!

34
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,666
You were the minority when
you came to this country.

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,900
Things seem to have
worked out for you.

36
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,466
I first wanted to do
standup comedy when I saw

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,266
Margaret Cho do
standup on television.

38
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,733
She was a Korean American woman,

39
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:12,300
but as an Indian kid that was
as close as we were going to

40
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,766
get at that point.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,233
MARGARET: I was in
Mobile, Alabama.

42
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,766
I was walking down the
street and this man

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,166
actually calls me a chink.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,033
I mean actually
called me a chink.

45
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:23,000
I was so mad.

46
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,866
I just looked at
him and said chink.

47
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,600
I'm sorry.
Chinks are Chinese.

48
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,600
I'm Korean.
I'm a gook. All right.

49
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Get like a redneck to
English dictionary.

50
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,733
HARI: That fearlessness.

51
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:41,466
She stood out and it made me
believe there was a chance

52
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,800
that I could perform in front
of people and be accepted.

53
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:53,433
The future that people in this
country seem to be afraid of.

54
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,333
Where there's many
different cultures,

55
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:56,900
where whites are the minority.

56
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,033
Yeah. I grew up
in the future.

57
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,866
That's Queens.

58
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,900
I was always surrounded by
diversity like if anything,

59
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,966
I was sheltered in diversity,
I just assumed the whole

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,900
country was like
Queens, New York.

61
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:13,766
NARRATOR: When Hari's parents
came to the United States,

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,466
they were part of a historic
wave of new immigrants who

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,533
would change America.

64
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:24,433
Today Asians in America are
making their presence felt,

65
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:27,166
as the country's fastest
growing racial group.

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,233
In a time where we find
ourselves increasingly

67
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:36,466
polarized, Asian Americans are
playing an essential role in

68
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,233
the future of America.

69
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:54,366
In the late 1970s refugees
are escaping war-torn

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Southeast Asia, and coming
to the United States.

71
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:02,000
They settle in the big cities,
but they also move to small

72
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,233
towns across the country.

73
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:10,833
MEE: Growing up, I always
identify as being Hmong,

74
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,866
not even Hmong-American.

75
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:16,533
My family came to the
United States in 1978.

76
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,333
We were refugees in the
aftermath of the Vietnam War.

77
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,866
I grew up in the Midwest.

78
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:31,433
And I remember walking my
brothers and sisters to school

79
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:34,866
and we would have cars go by.

80
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,466
People would throw their
ashtrays out the window at us,

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,466
you know, give us the finger.

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,066
They would say, you know,

83
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,233
"Chink, gook, go back
to your own country."

84
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:50,466
I didn't grow up
with a consciousness that

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,166
actually there were
other Asian Americans

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,266
experiencing similar things.

87
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,400
It felt very isolating.

88
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:00,500
Uh, and it felt like we
just had to suck it up.

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,933
NARRATOR: Mee Moua's
perspective would be

90
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:08,133
drastically transformed by
an event that will rock

91
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,333
the Asian American community.

92
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,566
It happens in Detroit on
a summer night in 1982.

93
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,366
REPORTER: Was
Vincent Chin beaten to death

94
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,866
with a baseball bat
because he was Oriental?

95
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,033
The brutal slaying has
outraged the Chinese community

96
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:27,266
in Detroit, and
across the nation.

97
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:32,433
HELEN: I had gone to Detroit
in the mid-seventies to be

98
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,400
involved in community
organizing and to learn about

99
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:37,133
the Heartland of America.

100
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,966
I actually arrived in Detroit
when the auto industry was

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,733
still booming and I got hired
in as a large press operator

102
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,666
in a Chrysler corporation
stamping plant.

103
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:56,766
These were well paid
jobs with full benefits.

104
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
The city had millions of
people whose livelihoods for

105
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:03,700
generations have been based
on a manufacturing economy.

106
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,900
Then the bottom fell out.

107
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:12,766
NARRATOR: In 1979 Detroit's
automakers are devastated by

108
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,333
an international oil crisis.

109
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,000
Gas prices skyrocket.

110
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Consumers start buying fuel
efficient foreign cars and

111
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,833
sales of American-made
cars plummet.

112
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:31,166
By 1982 one in five Detroit
residents are unemployed.

113
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:36,466
HELEN: People lost their futures
and their children's futures.

114
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,933
Pretty soon the finger of
blame ended up on Japan.

115
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,100
All of this hatred.

116
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:47,500
You could feel it.
It was palpable.

117
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:50,000
REPORTER: Detroiters
were invited for 50 cents a

118
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,500
smash to take out their
anger on Japanese cars.

119
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:57,900
HELEN: It was in that climate
of intense hatred that a

120
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:02,666
27 year old Chinese American
was getting ready for his

121
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,333
all American bachelor party.

122
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,866
NARRATOR: Vincent Chin is
the only child of a Chinese

123
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,833
immigrant couple, who adopted
him because they couldn't have

124
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,200
children of their own.

125
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:18,466
As a teenager he was a
football player with a wide

126
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,600
circle of friends.

127
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,733
By the summer of 1982, he's
all set for a June wedding

128
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:26,766
to his long-time
girlfriend, Vicky.

129
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,900
HELEN: A week
before his wedding,

130
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:36,466
he was out with his buddies
at a bar in Detroit.

131
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,866
REPORTER: Inside the bar,
43 year old Ronald Ebens,

132
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,933
a foreman at a
Chrysler auto plant,

133
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:45,366
and his 23 year old stepson
Michael Nitz taunted Chin,

134
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,066
mistaking him for Japanese
and accusing him for the

135
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,633
economic downfall of
the US auto industry.

136
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,133
NARRATOR: The fight ends up
outside where the assailants

137
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,233
hunt down Chin
and his friends.

138
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,900
REPORTER:
According to witnesses,

139
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:04,800
Ebens took this bat out of
the trunk of his car and

140
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,566
repeatedly used it to hammer
and crush Chin's skull.

141
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,800
As his friends held him,
his last words were,

142
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,333
"It isn't fair.
It isn't fair."

143
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,500
NARRATOR: Vincent's killers
plead guilty to manslaughter

144
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,533
and face 15 years in prison.

145
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,133
But Judge Charles Kaufman
sentences them to

146
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,800
three years' probation
and a $3,000 fine.

147
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:34,600
He says, "These aren't the
kind of men you send to prison""

148
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,433
VIET: I think theVincent Chin murder was

149
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,566
shocking to a lotof Asian Americans.

150
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Not because itrepresented something new,

151
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,933
but that it actually
represented something old.

152
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:52,000
It reminded Asian-Americans
that progress

153
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,200
hadn't really been made.

154
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:59,000
HELEN: In 1882 you could
kill a quote China man and

155
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,766
get off paying $1.

156
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,300
In 1982 you can kill an
Asian American and get off

157
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,033
paying $3,000.

158
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:13,500
This was not justice, but
there wasn't an organization

159
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:16,866
that existed to stand up
and say, this is wrong.

160
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:24,400
What began out of that was
meetings that started with

161
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:29,400
four people, 10 people,
20 people, 100 people,

162
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:33,733
and people were talking
about what can we do?

163
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,933
What can we do?
What can we do?

164
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,600
I raised my hand and I said,
the world wants to know how

165
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,733
the Asian American
community feels about this.

166
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,700
CROWD: We want justice.
We want justice.

167
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,600
REPORTER: In death.

168
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,366
Vincent Chin inspired
protest marches, rallies,

169
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,333
dinners, banquets.

170
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,566
GROUP: Justice for Vincent Chin!

171
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,666
HELEN: The killing of
Vincent Chin is probably the

172
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,066
most tragic example of the kind
of violence that's being

173
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,766
committed against Asians.

174
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,533
JEFF: For Asian Americans,
Vincent Chin's murder

175
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:14,366
symbolized an extreme
example of the kind of

176
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,933
discrimination that they'd face.

177
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,800
It becomes a rallying
point for Asian Americans

178
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:24,366
to be able to say,
"That's me too."

179
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,366
MEE: I was a freshman in
college when I heard about

180
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,000
Vincent Chin and the impact on
the Asian American community.

181
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:38,066
And it was the first time that
I felt like my experience as a

182
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,866
Hmong refugee, as a Southeast
Asian was connected to the

183
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,633
experience of other
Asian Americans.

184
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:51,800
I am finally a piece of the
puzzle that completes the

185
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,266
picture and it
was so liberating.

186
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,666
HELEN: Civil rights
organizations of every kind

187
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,333
came forward as
well as individuals.

188
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:11,666
JESSE: We have been
drawn together by death,

189
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:16,500
an unplanned family reunion,

190
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,333
our hearts are made heavy
by a mother who sits here

191
00:11:21,366 --> 00:11:25,166
with us whose
son was brutally killed just

192
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:30,300
because he was, what can
we do in the aftermath?

193
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,133
Those who live, we
must redefine America,

194
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,600
So that everybody
knows everybody fits

195
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,266
in the rainbow somewhere.

196
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,266
HELEN: Mrs. Chin was the
inspirational and spiritual

197
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,400
leader of this movement.

198
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:58,033
Many of the ways that she's
been seen is to remember her

199
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:02,333
as a grieving mother, but to
know her, she was a strong,

200
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,533
outspoken woman.

201
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:09,400
LILY: You know how
they killed my son?

202
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:14,633
Killed my son.
Like they kill an animal.

203
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,066
DONAHUE: Like they kill
an animal. Yes ma'am.

204
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
LILY: This made me very angry.

205
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,400
DONAHUE: Yes ma'am.

206
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:26,233
HELEN: Lilly Chin's husband
had just died six months

207
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,900
before Vincent was
attacked and killed.

208
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:32,633
Her son had already been
shopping and looking for a

209
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:36,533
house that would have a room
for his mother to live in and

210
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:39,900
there was nothing more
that Mrs. Chin wanted

211
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,933
than to have grandchildren.

212
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,933
Even through her pain.

213
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:47,966
She was standing up,
speaking up, organizing.

214
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:53,966
LILY: I don't want any other
mother to suffer like me.

215
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:02,766
HELEN: We began to look at the
different civil rights laws.

216
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,600
There were constitutional
law professors who

217
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,400
came out and said,

218
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:12,000
"Civil rights laws
are only meant to protect

219
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:13,600
African Americans."

220
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,700
We had to talk to them and
say, no, that's not true.

221
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,233
As an Asian American, he was
being isolated and targeted

222
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:25,066
and scapegoated because of his
race in this climate of hate.

223
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,366
So of course, civil
rights laws should apply.

224
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,066
NARRATOR: Under
mounting pressure,

225
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,266
the Justice Department
agrees to bring charges.

226
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,166
This is the first hate-crime
prosecution involving

227
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,266
an Asian American.

228
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,333
Ronald Ebens is found guilty
of violating Vincent's

229
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,066
civil rights and is sentenced
to 25 years in prison.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,233
But his conviction is
overturned on appeal.

231
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,766
Neither he nor his
stepson will ever serve

232
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,300
a day in prison for
Vincent's murder.

233
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:03,700
LILY: I wanted justice for
my son, this is not fair...

234
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:13,200
MEE: All the things that went
wrong didn't give justice to

235
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:18,333
Vincent's mom, but what
it did do was it invited

236
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,866
Asian Americans to search
our voices and demand that

237
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,433
we are seeing beyond being
the perpetual foreigner,

238
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,200
but that we actually belong.

239
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:31,800
This is our country.

240
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:35,266
HELEN: Vincent Chin's
case has a legacy that

241
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,133
affects all Americans.
Even to this day.

242
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,700
MEE: A hate crime now is
not just an act committed

243
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,333
on somebody because
of who they are, but

244
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:49,066
because of who the perpetrator
perceived them to be.

245
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,100
That's one of the
concrete legacies

246
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,500
of the Vincent Chin case.

247
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,666
NARRATOR: Mee Moa's activism
led her to a career as the

248
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,466
first Hmong
politician in the U.S.

249
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:12,200
Though she came to this
country as a refugee,

250
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:15,533
she was elected to the
Minnesota senate in 2002,

251
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,733
where she will
serve for 8 years.

252
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:24,166
The early 1980s is
a tipping point:

253
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,066
the Asian American population
flips from majority US-born

254
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,866
to largely foreign-born.

255
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,166
New neighborhoods pop up
all over the United States.

256
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,666
One of the biggest is in
the heart of Los Angeles,

257
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,033
an enclave that comes to
be known as Koreatown.

258
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:55,266
ANGELA: Koreatown was a
physical space where you could

259
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,033
migrate here and never have
to encounter the mainstream.

260
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,700
We had our grocery stores,
our restaurants,

261
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,500
watch repair stores,
wig shops, you name it.

262
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:11,533
You could transact daily life
without breaking into English.

263
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,166
ALEX: When I think
about Koreatown,

264
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,600
I really think about the
Sundays with my family.

265
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:22,200
It would be like a whole day,

266
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,033
we'd like go
there in the morning,

267
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,833
go to church service.

268
00:16:25,866 --> 00:16:28,366
And then after that we'd go
and have like a family meal

269
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,200
together and my parents
would go to the video store.

270
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,966
For our family and
many families a store

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,100
was like a second home.

272
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,766
We had birthday parties
there and I know a lot of

273
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,966
Korean American store owners
had a little cot in the back

274
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,633
or someplace where
people ate meals.

275
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:53,500
(singing in Korean)

276
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,900
NARRATOR: Korean immigrants
like Alex's parents look for

277
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,766
opportunities where the cost
of business is affordable.

278
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,800
For many, this means looking
beyond the borders of

279
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,133
Koreatown in places
like South Los Angeles.

280
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,466
These neighborhoods are
predominantly black and

281
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,733
Latinx, with their own
identities and histories.

282
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:20,433
BRENDA: Many people of color
and African Americans in

283
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:24,400
particular were
disappointed, frustrated, um,

284
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,533
agitated about, um,
social conditions,

285
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:31,133
about the lack of jobs,
about policing in Los Angeles.

286
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,266
And so you have an African
American community that in

287
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,000
some ways is like an immigrant
community because we've never

288
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,100
been completely integrated
within the society.

289
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:48,033
NARRATOR: In March of 1991, the
world watches as Los Angeles

290
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,766
police officers beat a 26
year old African American

291
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
man named Rodney King.

292
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:59,133
ANGELA: Back then in the 90s,
I was just a lawyer when a

293
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,766
number of us who practiced
in that area saw that video.

294
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:07,133
Our reaction was, well, it's
about time the rest of the

295
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,533
world see what happens on
the streets of South LA.

296
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,233
MAN: We are not
going to take this racist

297
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,400
police brutality
in our streets.

298
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,133
HELEN: Unfortunately in our
Asian American community,

299
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,833
many of the newer immigrants
who come have no idea of the

300
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:28,500
civil rights
history in America.

301
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:33,666
ANGELA: The civil rights laws
that came into effect in the

302
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,033
60s were the product
of huge fights,

303
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,566
mostly led by
African Americans.

304
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:43,500
Sacrifices that were made
by African Americans.

305
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:47,466
None of this was appreciated
by the majority of new

306
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,533
immigrants who came
after the fact.

307
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,833
ALEX: You know, my parents
didn't have any understanding

308
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,866
that there was the civil
rights movement or the

309
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,666
history of racial
equality in this country.

310
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:00,700
They didn't know
anything about that.

311
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,966
ANGELA: In South L.A.
you had a region that was

312
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,800
historically an established
African American community

313
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,233
being transformed into
a Latinx community.

314
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,066
There's competition for jobs.

315
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,566
There's competition
for housing.

316
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,333
BRENDA: Close to 70% of
businesses were owned by

317
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,866
Korean Americans.

318
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,700
There was a notion that
the shop owners had been

319
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,900
disrespectful, had
been dismissive.

320
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,766
MAN: Yeah, prices are high.

321
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,233
Their attitude is wrong and
they just don't seem to have

322
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:32,733
any respect for the
black community.

323
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,933
ANGELA: In the
Korean community,

324
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,066
there's an anxiety because
there was a lot of news about

325
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,133
assaults, robberies, shootings
that were being reported in,

326
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:48,033
in language news, but if you
read the LA times Metro section,

327
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,100
all you read about when
it came to Koreans was

328
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,800
how rude they were,
how racist they were.

329
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,100
JEFF: What we see is a lot
of media trying to play up

330
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,066
Asian and black tensions.

331
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,066
ALEX: I'm sure that's a much
easier narrative to build and

332
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,100
write than something about the
hundreds of years of racial

333
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,666
inequality and social
inequality in America.

334
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,900
BRENDA: Latasha Harlins was a
15 year old African American

335
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:22,833
girl who lived in
South Central Los Angeles.

336
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:27,233
She went into a grocery
slash liquor store in her

337
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:31,233
neighborhood on March 16th,
1991 to purchase a bottle of

338
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,333
orange juice for $1.79.

339
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,166
The proprietress Mrs. Soon Ja Du
accuses her of stealing,

340
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,566
pulls her across the counter.

341
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,666
Latasha responds by punching
her, a fight ensues.

342
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,600
Latasha bends down to pick up
the orange juice and Mrs. Du

343
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:52,266
has stood up with
a gun in her hand.

344
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:55,066
Latasha turns to walk
out of the store and

345
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,533
she shot in the
back of the head.

346
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:06,066
JEFF: This particular incident
comes to represent all these

347
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,300
grievances that have
been building up.

348
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,233
REPORTER: A jury convicted
Du of voluntary manslaughter.

349
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:14,466
A pre-sentence report
recommended the maximum

350
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,966
16 years, but judge Joyce
Karlin imposed probation,

351
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,833
a $500 fine, no jail time.

352
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:26,266
JEFF: This is literally
10 years after the

353
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,400
killing of Vincent Chin.

354
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,166
Wasn't the equivalent to
Vincent Chin, Latasha Harlins?

355
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:38,366
But in this case, certain
Asian-Americans organized

356
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,900
to support Soon Ja Du.

357
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,900
HELEN: And instead of being
seen as a part of the

358
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:49,300
multiracial coalition,
suddenly Korean Americans

359
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,300
were seen as just like
those racist LA cops

360
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,733
who beat up Rodney King.

361
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:59,100
MAN: Go home
CROWD: Go home!

362
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:01,700
HELEN: People on the ground
within the Korean American and

363
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,933
African American communities
were trying to signal this

364
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,766
could be a problem.

365
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,633
Then all hell broke loose.

366
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:13,633
REPORTER: The
verdict stunned almost

367
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,666
everyone except the four
officers acquitted of

368
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
beating Rodney King.

369
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:19,966
Sheriff's deputies escorted
them from the courthouse to

370
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,533
face a hostile crowd.

371
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:37,333
ANGELA: We had five days
of looting, burning, arson,

372
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:41,233
chaos really in
the city of L.A.

373
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:44,133
CROWD: No justice, no peace.
No justice, no peace.

374
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,600
ANGELA: The fire department,
they felt unsafe rolling out.

375
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:52,133
So the city burned.

376
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,466
I mean I counted at one point
19 fires going simultaneously.

377
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:02,133
ALEX: I remember the whole
scene playing out on TV.

378
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,766
Much as the first Gulf War
played out on TV that it was

379
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,966
kind of, I don't know,
infotainment in a way.

380
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,666
REPORTER: Though the
riots were sparked by the

381
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,400
verdicts in the
Rodney King case.

382
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,566
They were fueled by
growing hostilities

383
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,633
between blacks and Koreans.

384
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:20,633
ALEX: I remember
my father said,

385
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,466
he knew that this wasn't good.

386
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,233
That this media narrative that
Koreans and black people

387
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:27,366
were in this conflict.

388
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:30,800
BRENDA: As people left
South central and went up to

389
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:34,400
Koreatown, Latasha's name
was heard on the streets.

390
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,233
You know, "This is for Latasha.
This is for Latasha."

391
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,000
ANGELA: The police were
not coming to protect

392
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,833
any of these stores.

393
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:47,033
Most of them owned by
immigrant families from Korea.

394
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,366
The Korean community itself
went over the airwaves and

395
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,366
they were calling for
people to show up wherever

396
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,266
they could with arms.

397
00:23:57,966 --> 00:24:00,233
A lot of the men
in the community,

398
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:03,300
first generation immigrants
had served in the military

399
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,600
'cause it's
mandatory in Korea.

400
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,566
So they had firearms, they
knew how to use firearms

401
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,000
and they started defending
their own stores.

402
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:17,900
ALEX: The strongest
memory I have, the one

403
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:21,533
that goes deepest is I had a
conversation with my father,

404
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,633
we sat on the couch
in our living room.

405
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,166
He came and sat
down next to me.

406
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,400
He said that the violence
and looting in Koreatown was

407
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:34,900
getting really bad and that
he had to go and defend the

408
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:39,400
store, that he had obtained
a gun and that he was

409
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,433
going to go down there.

410
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:43,766
And um...

411
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:52,566
Even now it's a very
painful memory that, um,

412
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,866
basically he may
not come back.

413
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,866
NARRATOR: Alex's parents'
store is destroyed along with

414
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,166
more than 2,000 other
Korean owned businesses.

415
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,700
WOMAN: This is America.

416
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,266
We have to stand our pride.

417
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,566
Human dignity.
Where is your human dignity?

418
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:25,733
We are human beings,
we have to have dignity.

419
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:29,266
We don't do things like this.

420
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,566
JEFF: I mean it was, it was
one of those moments that

421
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,233
actually really changed my
life because it was like

422
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:40,500
war had broken out and
I knew people that

423
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,700
I deeply loved on both sides.

424
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,000
And for me, you know, I
had come up really deeply

425
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:53,766
believing in this third world
strike ideal and this idea of,

426
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,900
of a rainbow coalition,
it was like,

427
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:01,300
not just people whose
lives were at stake,

428
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,400
but also our revolutionary
dreams are kind of

429
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:07,200
going up in smoke.

430
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,466
NARRATOR: As a result of
the unrest in Los Angeles,

431
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,066
63 people lose their lives,

432
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,766
with damages estimated
at $1 billion.

433
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:29,366
ALEX: Because the rioting had
destroyed their businesses,

434
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,733
my family's financial
situation changed drastically,

435
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:35,300
had to move from
where we were living.

436
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,233
They were under tremendous
stress to figure out what

437
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:40,966
they're going to do to,
like feed me and my brother.

438
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,500
That trauma stayed with them,
like marked them as people.

439
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,633
I made a documentary about

440
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,700
my family's experience
with the riots.

441
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:04,733
ALEX: After the riots,
my parents and I barely

442
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:09,533
discussed it, so the film was
a way for me and my parents

443
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:11,500
to like engage about it.

444
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:25,333
ALEX: I think about
when I should tell

445
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:26,966
my daughter about riots.

446
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,033
Like when is she old enough
for me to explain the riots

447
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,900
are part of her family's
journey here in this country.

448
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,033
I wouldn't be able to speak
of our experiences in this

449
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:41,400
country, our immigrant story,
without talking about that.

450
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:47,400
I recognize now the reason
that Koreatown burned down.

451
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,600
That was a neighborhood that
was brought up, established,

452
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:54,700
populated by people who are
themselves marginalized.

453
00:27:57,233 --> 00:28:01,966
If those businesses were in the
well-heeled parts of this town,

454
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,166
do you think that the
mayor would let that burn down?

455
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,500
Never.

456
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:13,033
They would go down themselves
to protect those places.

457
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,066
There's no way that they
would let that happen.

458
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,400
So, you know, we were victims
as well, of this system.

459
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,966
(inaudible chanting)

460
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:26,600
CROWD: We want justice.
We want justice.

461
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,933
ANGELA: There was a
consciousness that woke

462
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:32,766
out of the fire and the chaos
and the crisis that hit LA.

463
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:37,633
Korean America
was born in 1992.

464
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,600
NARRATOR: On May 2nd as
the violence subsides,

465
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:46,333
30,000 people gather in
Koreatown for a peace rally.

466
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:56,833
ANGELA: It was a huge March that
took us down Olympic Boulevard.

467
00:28:57,133 --> 00:29:00,233
That kind of diversity that
you would expect to see in LA.

468
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:02,533
There were African Americans,
there were Latinos,

469
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,466
there were Koreans,
there were whites.

470
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,866
Everyone was present.

471
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:12,000
We wanted to send a message
that we also want justice and

472
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:15,100
we also want peace.

473
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:19,466
BRENDA: We had emerging now
these new leaders within the

474
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,700
Korean American community
and this leadership has been

475
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:27,266
working with African American
leadership to move forward.

476
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,233
MAN: We have a dream as
late Martin Luther King

477
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:34,333
had a dream.

478
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:38,533
That we together will be
able to establish a nation of

479
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:42,000
justice and peace and
we are here to stay.

480
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,166
VIET: My parents
were shopkeepers.

481
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,966
And I think it would take a
little bit of time for me to

482
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,200
think through what all
these things meant.

483
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:52,733
Like every population,

484
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:55,766
Asian Americans have
choices to make.

485
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,100
They can dwell on their own
victimization which is a

486
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:00,600
choice that is there for
every so-called minority

487
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,666
and for the majority.

488
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,600
They can choose to
side with power or

489
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:06,100
to be complicit with power.

490
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:09,033
And to be perpetrators or to
at least enjoy the profits of

491
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:11,600
being aligned
with perpetrators.

492
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,366
Or they could refuse these kinds
of choices and instead seek to

493
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,500
transform the system
into something more just,

494
00:30:21,533 --> 00:30:23,833
more equitable for everyone.

495
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:27,500
That's the hope of activism,
that's the hope of solidarity.

496
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,166
That's the hope of alliance,
that's the hope and the

497
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,700
conviction from which
something like the Asian

498
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:34,066
American movement was born.

499
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:42,466
MOM: Margaret, do you know
why I encourage your brother

500
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,233
to become a cardiologist?

501
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:45,333
MARGARET: No.

502
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:46,933
MOM: Because I always
knew that one day

503
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:49,466
you give me a heart attack,
what are you wearing!

504
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:54,500
RANDALL: In 1994 I remember
"All-American Girl" coming out

505
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:57,333
and it being a big
deal because it was uh,

506
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,866
an Asian family on TV.

507
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,400
MARGARET: I'm American,
Eric is American,

508
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:03,900
even Stuart is American.

509
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,566
Tell her.

510
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,633
RANDALL: And I remember there
being criticisms of the show

511
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,666
and even from within
like, the community,

512
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,866
but I remember watching it and
just thinking it was like so

513
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,766
great to see this
and normalizing,

514
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:21,266
HARI: Well there was a whole
group of films in like the

515
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,500
late 90s all about like
a middle class Indian life.

516
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:30,133
MAN: Leaving the house
is leaving the house

517
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,500
no matter where you go.

518
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:34,233
And just be a good boy
and let her do a poojah.

519
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:36,933
HARI: And they were terrible.

520
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:39,733
But that's, you know, we
had to create art for,

521
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:42,266
for us to represent our stories
'cause they weren't being told.

522
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,433
WOMAN: Okay, looks nice,
now smile naturally mom.

523
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,800
MOM: I always do...

524
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:50,033
WOMAN 2: You look younger all
the time, how is that?

525
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:53,533
MOM 2: I give you my good skin,
you will look like me when...

526
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,033
VIET: I went to a local
bookstore and came across

527
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:58,500
Amy Tan's "The Joy Luck Club",
which had just come out.

528
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,833
I had never seen a book before
written by an Asian-American

529
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,100
about Asian-Americans.

530
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,666
And even if it wasn't
about Vietnamese people,

531
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,000
it was close enough.

532
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:08,700
I was like, wow, this
is an amazing book.

533
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,300
And I can't believe the
story is being told and

534
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,066
in such a powerful way.

535
00:32:12,866 --> 00:32:15,433
JERRY: The kinds of stories I
heard from my grandmother who

536
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:19,666
escaped to mainland China in
1949 by herself with five kids.

537
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:25,200
For my kids' generation,
it's like fairy tale.

538
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:28,100
It's hard to believe that
war was 60 years ago.

539
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,466
You know, in some ways she
hated the country she came

540
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,900
from because the
Communists tortured her.

541
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:38,466
She never looked back.

542
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,300
But her mission in life
was to make sure her kids

543
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,666
and then her grandkids
had it better.

544
00:32:45,033 --> 00:32:47,200
NARRATOR: Jerry Yang
was born in Taiwan,

545
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,966
and was 2 years old
when his father died.

546
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:54,333
His widowed mother decided to
emigrate the family to America.

547
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,300
When he arrived he only knew
one word of English, shoe.

548
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:04,866
JERRY: My mom was a single
mother and I was the first born,

549
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,533
so I was expected to
go to college, get a job,

550
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:10,333
make money so my mom doesn't
have to pay for us anymore.

551
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:14,900
NARRATOR: Jerry is accepted
to Stanford University.

552
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:18,633
There, he forms a partnership
with fellow student David Filo.

553
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,366
The two of them create a
business that changes

554
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,833
the way that Americans
engage with the world.

555
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:32,033
MAN: Do you, uh, Yahoo?

556
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:38,133
JERRY: When the worldwide web
started in 1989 we had this

557
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:41,066
explosion of content that
you'd never had before.

558
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:48,766
David and I said, Hey, maybe
we can try to keep track of

559
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,866
all these websites
that are coming online.

560
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,366
We had no idea that it
would be a business.

561
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,833
For the longest
time it was called

562
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:58,633
Jerry's Guide to
the Worldwide Web.

563
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:00,600
By the end of the 1994

564
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:03,400
we were one of the largest
websites in the world.

565
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:09,200
You're literally laying
down the train tracks

566
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:10,900
as the train is running.

567
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:12,833
And you just got to
stay ahead of it.

568
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,400
OANH: I was a young
reporter in Silicon Valley,

569
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,033
started at the
Mercury News in 1998.

570
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,166
It was a really exciting
time because, you know,

571
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,666
the tech boom was in full mode.

572
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:31,266
You really felt this was at
the center of where things

573
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,600
were going to happen that was
going to change the world.

574
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
ANNALEE: In the early 90s
supplies of white and

575
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:41,533
native born talent really dried
up and you started to see the

576
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:44,900
influx in large numbers of
highly skilled Asian immigrants.

577
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:50,966
Close to 40% of the new startups
were from Asian entrepreneurs.

578
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:54,933
OANH: You know,
Asian-Americans have been a

579
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:57,700
very important part of the
rise of big industries.

580
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:03,000
You know in the 1860s you
had the Chinese who were

581
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:06,166
so integral to building the
transcontinental railroad.

582
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,466
Going into the 21st century
there were Asian Americans

583
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,166
who were becoming founders
with fantastic visions.

584
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,900
If you were lucky enough to
have gone to American schools

585
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,566
and get a US education,
Silicon Valley and that

586
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,900
boom was fantastic for them.

587
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,200
There were a lot of people
who had to do the hard work

588
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:30,366
of actually manufacturing
the guts of what goes into

589
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,566
computers at the time.

590
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,266
And those people,
unfortunately though they were

591
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,633
immigrants from China,
immigrants from Vietnam,

592
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:41,133
most of them didn't have the
college education that these

593
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,200
other engineers did.

594
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,166
They basically would be
putting transistors on circuit

595
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,533
boards and getting
paid by the piece.

596
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:51,600
For every printed circuit
board that you finished.

597
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:53,600
And that's why it's
called piece work.

598
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,866
Some of the biggest names
in Silicon Valley were using

599
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,666
Asian immigrant workers
to do piece work at home.

600
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,666
We ended up doing a nine
month investigation into

601
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,133
piece work in Silicon Valley.

602
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:10,933
We were looking at violations
that included child labor,

603
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:12,900
minimum wage violations.

604
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:17,033
So you do have kind of this
barbell division, right,

605
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:20,066
where you have Asian Americans
at the very top who are doing

606
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,100
really well, who are
the model minorities.

607
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:25,900
And at the very bottom
you also have a different

608
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,766
flavoring of Asian Americans
who are really struggling.

609
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,066
A lot of them were refugees
like myself and my family.

610
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,233
You know, there
weren't too many people in the

611
00:36:37,266 --> 00:36:39,900
"San Jose Mercury"
newsroom who can go into the

612
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:43,000
Vietnamese American community to
ask them about piece work.

613
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,266
You know, in the aftermath,

614
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,533
I just realized that as
a journalist of color,

615
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:50,033
I need to be able to tell
the stories of my community.

616
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,000
NARRATOR: Jerry Yang draws
from his own bicultural

617
00:36:57,033 --> 00:37:00,500
experience as an immigrant
to become a maverick of the

618
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,766
internet revolution.

619
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,400
JERRY: During the starting
of the internet craze, and

620
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,200
starting Yahoo! I still
identified as Asian American.

621
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:10,733
There was no question.

622
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:14,200
But especially when I went
back to Asia to do business,

623
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,833
my identity really helped.

624
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,366
ANNALEE: Immigrants were
part of opening up India.

625
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,200
Apple wouldn't be in
China without the help

626
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:25,366
of Asian immigrants.

627
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:28,833
You wouldn't have
manufacturing in Taiwan.

628
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:32,333
Many pieces of the global
economy are fueled by the

629
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:35,500
contributions of the Asian
immigrants in Silicon Valley.

630
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,366
JERRY: If you look
at our children,

631
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,866
they live in a more global
world today than we did

632
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,600
30 years ago, but in
many ways more divided.

633
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,100
And for me, making sure
they know who they are,

634
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:57,733
the history of the places
that they come from,

635
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:00,400
first and foremost, America.

636
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,733
You want to prepare them
to be the most impactful

637
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:06,100
citizens of their community
that they can be.

638
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,666
In many ways, that's
what my mom did for us

639
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,933
by moving to the US.

640
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:14,433
When people's backs are
against the wall and there's

641
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:16,666
nowhere else to go,
you go forward.

642
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,933
TEREZA: I started playing piano
when I was seven years old.

643
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,533
We couldn't afford lessons,
but my dad made me practice

644
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:47,866
three hours a day every day.

645
00:38:57,233 --> 00:39:00,500
My parents are
from South Korea.

646
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,500
They fled the aftermath of the
Korean War to South America.

647
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:09,433
I was born in Brazil and
when I was two years old,

648
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,200
we came to the United States.

649
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:16,933
Soon after my little
brother was born.

650
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:21,500
When I was seven years old,
my dad sat the whole family

651
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,800
around in the living
room and he said,

652
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:29,633
"I have a very serious secret
to tell you and that is that,

653
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,333
we are undocumented."

654
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:37,200
My dad said that if anyone
found out we were undocumented,

655
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,766
my parents would be sent
to the South Korea and

656
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,933
I would be sent to Brazil.

657
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:43,766
My brother, who was
born in Chicago,

658
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,933
sent to some foster care
because he's a US born citizen.

659
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:53,633
That made us become muted.

660
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:57,266
The fear of
separation is real.

661
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,166
We grew up having
nightmares of the police

662
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,866
storming up our stairs and
breaking our doors down

663
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,900
and taking our family away.

664
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,433
NARRATOR: The piano
is Tereza's sanctuary.

665
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:13,766
She gets a scholarship at
a music school in Chicago.

666
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,800
The artistic director
Ann Monaco takes Tereza

667
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,033
under her wing.

668
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,733
TEREZA: She proceeded to print
out 10 college applications

669
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:24,933
for me and she said, fill them
out and bring them back to me

670
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:27,466
as soon as you can.

671
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,033
She saw that my social
security number was blank.

672
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:33,833
She saw that my birthplace was
Brazil and she looked at me

673
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:36,200
and said, you were
born in Brazil?

674
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,600
I burst into tears and

675
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:42,066
begged her to not turn
me into the police.

676
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:46,333
She said, "Tereza,
do you trust me?"

677
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,866
NARRATOR: Ann Monaco makes
a plea on Tereza's behalf

678
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,433
to their Senator, Dick Durbin.

679
00:40:57,533 --> 00:41:00,166
DICK: Tereza Lee, under
the eyes of the law in the

680
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,100
United States was undocumented.

681
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,066
She was in the
United States illegally.

682
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,200
The law said the only thing
Tereza could do was leave the

683
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:12,033
United States for 10 years
and apply to come back.

684
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:15,400
Uh, I thought that was
a terrible outcome.

685
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:18,000
NARRATOR: Senator Durbin
drafts an immigration bill

686
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:21,366
specifically for Tereza
that puts her on a path to

687
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,533
citizenship and college,
but in the process,

688
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,433
he hears from more students
facing the same dilemma.

689
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:32,333
DICK: We realized
she was not alone.

690
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,366
There were thousands
just like her.

691
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,100
TEREZA: He needed to redraft
the whole thing into a larger

692
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:41,966
bill and that became
known as the "DREAM Act."

693
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,133
NARRATOR: The "DREAM Act" would
open a path to citizenship

694
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,733
for undocumented children

695
00:41:46,766 --> 00:41:49,333
who are brought to the
country as minors.

696
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:51,766
To qualify, they must
either join the military

697
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,266
or attend college.

698
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,000
They become known as dreamers.

699
00:41:57,266 --> 00:42:00,866
DICK: The first
dreamer was Tereza Lee.

700
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,233
My mother was an
immigrant to this country.

701
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:06,133
She didn't become a citizen
until she was in her

702
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:09,466
mid-20s, a mother
with two children.

703
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,700
If you're here through
no fault of your own,

704
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:13,800
you ought to have a chance
to prove yourself and

705
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:16,166
be part of America's future.

706
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,400
NARRATOR: The DREAM Act
is cosponsored by

707
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:20,500
Republican Senator Orrin Hatch.

708
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:22,433
The bill attracts
overwhelming support on

709
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:24,933
both sides of the aisle.

710
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:30,000
TEREZA: 2001 we
had a hearing set,

711
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:33,300
62 votes were lined up
and president Bush was

712
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,666
ready to sign it into law.

713
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:40,900
I was set to perform a little
concert for the senators.

714
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:45,833
I was ready to fly to DC
and the subways were closed.

715
00:42:46,866 --> 00:42:48,433
There were no cabs available.

716
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:51,333
Everyone was talking
about this attack.

717
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:57,300
BRYANT: It's 8:52
here in New York.

718
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,533
I'm Bryant Gumbel.

719
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:00,566
We understand that there has
been a plane crash on the

720
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,166
southern tip of Manhattan.

721
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,600
You're looking at the
World Trade Center.

722
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,500
HARI: 9/11 happened
when I was in college,

723
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:16,800
so I was so far from home.

724
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,200
My brother went to
Stuyvesant High School,

725
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:23,266
which is not that far from
where the Twin Towers were,

726
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,766
so that day was horrible
for everybody 'cause

727
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,866
my city was attacked.

728
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,033
I don't know where
my brother is.

729
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm very far away.
I feel very alone.

730
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,366
REPORTER: The terrorist attacks
have united much of America,

731
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,500
but some Arab
Americans are feeling left out.

732
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:45,166
Fearful they could become the
next target of misguided anger.

733
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,600
Since Tuesday's attacks, the
FBI reports 40 hate crimes,

734
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:51,700
suspected retaliation.

735
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:54,800
HARI: You had a lot of people
being beaten up because they

736
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,433
were brown skin, because
they were Muslim,

737
00:43:56,466 --> 00:43:57,833
because they were Sikh.

738
00:43:57,866 --> 00:43:59,900
REPORTER: In Mesa, Arizona,
a man from India was killed at

739
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:03,000
his convenience store because
he looked Middle Eastern.

740
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:08,966
HARI: One of the weird parts
about being a Brown person in

741
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,233
that post 9/11 era is
you get victimized twice.

742
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,033
Like on one hand you're
afraid of terrorism as much as

743
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:19,633
anybody else is at that point,
like that's all you're hearing

744
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:20,800
from the media.

745
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,400
And then your
country hates you.

746
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:25,766
They don't, they
don't say it openly,

747
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,933
but when people are
yelling things to you,

748
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,433
telling you to go back to
countries you're not even from

749
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:32,066
cause you're from America.

750
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,866
WOMAN: Go home.
You don't like America.

751
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,500
Leave this country.
We're proud to be Americans.

752
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:38,100
HARI: You start
to get the hint.

753
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:44,600
NORM: On Thursday, September
13 there was a cabinet meeting

754
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:48,366
with the House and Senate,

755
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,366
Democratic and
Republican leadership.

756
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,700
Congressmen from Detroit,
Michigan said, Mr. President,

757
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,366
we have a large population of
Middle Easterners and Muslims

758
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,966
and they're very concerned
about all the rhetoric.

759
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,800
President said, you're
absolutely correct.

760
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,166
We don't want to
have happen today

761
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,966
what happened to Norm in 1942.

762
00:45:15,266 --> 00:45:16,933
MAN: Before arrival
at their new quarters,

763
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:19,133
the evacuees
voluntarily registered.

764
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:22,066
What this means for
the Japs, nobody knows.

765
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,366
What it means to us,
everybody knows.

766
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:31,133
HARI: And it didn't happen
again in the same way.

767
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,833
REPORTER: The
Bush administration has been

768
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:36,233
conducting a top secret
surveillance program

769
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,833
without warrants in
Muslim communities.

770
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,933
JEFF: What happens after 9/11
is immigration policy moves

771
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:48,133
from trying to create
pathways to citizenship,

772
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:53,133
to being wholly about closing
the door and deporting people.

773
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,900
TEREZA: Any immigrant
friendly legislation

774
00:45:56,933 --> 00:45:59,300
was out of the question.

775
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:02,400
The DREAM Act was canceled
and that meant that the

776
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:05,166
undocumented
immigrants were at risk.

777
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:08,566
HARI: It wasn't so public,
let's round them up,

778
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,933
put them into camps.

779
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:12,500
But it was like,
quietly and quickly,

780
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:14,966
deport people,
arrest people.

781
00:46:16,466 --> 00:46:18,866
Like the Ansar Mahmoud case.

782
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,066
ANSAR: My name
is Ansar Mahmoud.

783
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,800
I'm here for the something
happening after 9/11.

784
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,633
That's the reason I'm here.

785
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:40,133
NARRATOR: Born in Pakistan,
Ansar Mahmoud moved to

786
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:43,566
New York's Hudson Valley in
2000 after his dream came true:

787
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:47,566
he won a green card from
the immigration lottery.

788
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,133
ANSAR: I liked the quiet life,
you know, tried to relax.

789
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,766
Not too many people over
there, not too much noise.

790
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,433
All old houses.
I can see lots of mountains.

791
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,900
There's a nice river.

792
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,300
NARRATOR: One evening
in October 2001,

793
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:11,133
Ansar was taking photos of
the Hudson Valley landscape

794
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,400
to send home to his family.

795
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:16,700
He ducks behind a fence
to get a better view,

796
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,366
not realizing he has
stumbled onto the grounds

797
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,533
of a water treatment facility.

798
00:47:22,066 --> 00:47:23,866
REPORTER: DPW crews
saw him and they did report

799
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,966
to the police.

800
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Hudson PD then called the
FBI who contacted INS

801
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:29,766
and the state police.

802
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:32,500
HARI: And even
after they cleared him,

803
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:33,933
even after they said,

804
00:47:33,966 --> 00:47:36,766
"Oh yea, this is just some
harmless guy taking a picture,"

805
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,433
they wanted to get rid of him.

806
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,933
REPORTER: In
searching his apartment,

807
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:45,166
federal authorities found he
had co-signed a lease for a

808
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,100
Pakistani couple who
had overstayed their visa.

809
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,133
HARI: It was fear.
Fear drove all of it.

810
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,166
REPORTER: One bigsource of comfort for Mahmood

811
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,700
is a group of people in
Hudson deeply concerned

812
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:59,100
about his case.

813
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:01,700
They are searching for
a way to keep him here.

814
00:48:01,733 --> 00:48:05,200
CROWD: Free Ansar, free Ansar!

815
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:10,300
ANSAR: These people, they make
my spirit high and high hope.

816
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,466
I still believe this
country is good.

817
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,133
It's valuable.

818
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,000
You can live here,
you can work.

819
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:26,800
MAN: Even after
all that's happened?

820
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,266
ANSAR: Even after
all that's happened.

821
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:32,866
DICK: I rise today to speak
about an issue which is

822
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,366
timely and controversial.

823
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,966
It's the issue of immigration.

824
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:40,366
NARRATOR: After September 11th,

825
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,800
the DREAM Act is reintroduced a
number of times in the Senate,

826
00:48:44,033 --> 00:48:46,700
but never achieves enough
votes to become law.

827
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:51,933
TEREZA: In 2012,
Dreamers started organizing.

828
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:55,900
(inaudible chanting)

829
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,600
CROWD: Now!

830
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,566
TEREZA: For the first time we
started seeing an immigration

831
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,666
movement, not just
undocumented immigrants,

832
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,533
but other Americans
coming out to support.

833
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,333
HELEN: On the one hand,
communities are now under

834
00:49:14,366 --> 00:49:16,400
intense investigation.

835
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:19,800
On the other hand, it's also
brought communities together.

836
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:23,400
HARI: 9/11 happens.

837
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:26,200
I go from someone who's
sheltered in diversity and

838
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:28,933
fairly apolitical to
a politicized being.

839
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,300
I was an immigrant
rights organizer.

840
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,066
I worked with victims
of hate crimes,

841
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,066
people being detained
and deported,

842
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,233
and I wanted my standup,

843
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,666
my art form to reflect
what I believed.

844
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,466
I hate how immigrants are
talked about in this country.

845
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,066
I was watching CNN,
which was my mistake,

846
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,366
and they were interviewing
this woman in Arizona who is

847
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,800
against immigration, right?

848
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:54,400
And she said, look, we're just
trying to bring this country

849
00:49:54,433 --> 00:49:56,433
back to the way it used to be.

850
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,800
The way it used to be!

851
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:03,366
Lady, you're in Arizona.
It used to be Mexico.

852
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:09,833
Growing up I always felt like
I had access to the world.

853
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:11,233
People from all
over the world.

854
00:50:11,266 --> 00:50:12,733
Different races, religions,

855
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:14,433
people with status,
without status.

856
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:17,500
Like I felt, looking
back on it now,

857
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:20,600
I feel like I was
trained for the future.

858
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,766
NARRATOR: They were
seen as outsiders...

859
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,933
Dreamers who could
never become American.

860
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But they were always American.

861
00:50:39,466 --> 00:50:43,600
By arriving on these shores,
by seeking a better destiny,

862
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:46,333
by giving their all,

863
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,933
by building up the
nation rail by rail.

864
00:50:51,066 --> 00:50:55,366
By claiming their space.
By striving for justice.

865
00:50:57,233 --> 00:50:59,700
By struggling for the
rights of all people,

866
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:01,466
not just their own.

867
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,933
They have always been American.

868
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,566
HELEN: History has a
way of moving in cycles,

869
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,433
and if we can learn from
history even a little bit,

870
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:15,100
we can avoid repeating it.

871
00:51:15,133 --> 00:51:17,700
But even better than that, we
can find the things that have

872
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:21,633
moved civilization forward and
have led to greater progress.

873
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:25,200
And if we learned from that,
we can really move ahead.

874
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:31,666
JEFF: The idea of being Asian
American originated in part as

875
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,666
a will to power.

876
00:51:34,766 --> 00:51:38,266
As a way to be able to
say we've been stepped on,

877
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,066
we've been excluded,
we've been erased.

878
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:45,033
And you need to
recognize us now.

879
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,600
Because we're here and
we're not going away.

880
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,133
VIET: The very idea of the
Asian American contains

881
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:58,466
within itself an endless
range of possibilities...

882
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,600
Is a part of who we are!

883
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,166
CONNIE: We honor the courage,
fortitude and sacrifice of

884
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,966
Chinese railroad workers and
their legacy in America which

885
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,400
belongs to all of us!

886
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:21,066
ERICA: The Asian American
story is such a quintessential

887
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,000
American story because we,

888
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:26,400
as Asian Americans,

889
00:52:26,433 --> 00:52:28,266
have represented
the polar extremes of

890
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,833
the American experience.

891
00:52:30,866 --> 00:52:35,000
The most downtrodden and
discriminated against,

892
00:52:35,633 --> 00:52:39,466
to rising to positions
of power and privilege.

893
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,600
To being singled
out for exclusion,

894
00:52:43,633 --> 00:52:48,166
to being explicitly welcomed,
and included, and held up,

895
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:51,933
of the very best of America.

896
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:53,800
That is the story of America,

897
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,266
and that is the story
of Asian America.

898
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,866
